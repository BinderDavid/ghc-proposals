# `\cases` - Multi-way lambda expressions

This proposal introduces a syntactic construct that provides functionality to
case split on the arguments of multi-parameter lambda expressions.

## Motivation

In Haskell 2010, there are two syntaxes to define a function: via the function
definition syntax, or via lambda expressions. The most obvious difference
between these is that the former assigns a name to the function, whereas the
latter can be used to create anonymous functions. However, the differences go
significantly beyond that:

 - Lambda expressions can only have a single clause, function declarations
   can have an arbitrary non-zero number of equations
 - Lambda expressions cannot have guards
 - Lambda expressions must have at least one parameter

There have been multiple attempts in the past to bring the capabilities of
lambda expressions closer to those of function declarations:

 1. The extension `-XLambdaCase` introduces a `\case` construct which allows
    lambda expression to have multiple clauses, however, only one pattern can
    be matched on. Like a regular `case`-expression, this can also have guards.
    [During its
    implementation](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/4359#note_44819)
    as well as [after it](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/18),
    there were attempts to make it possible to match on multiple patterns. No
    solution was found, in part because this would make it different from
    regular case-expressions.
    - If there were an expression that had pattern matching syntax more similar
      to lambda expressions but which could also have guards and multiple clauses,
      it could be used instead of `-XLambdaCase` and would be able to match on
      multiple patterns.
 2. The extension `-XMultiWayIf` essentially introduces standalone guards,
    simplifying the use of guards that aren't at the outermost level of a
    function declaration or case-expression. Among other things, this made it
    easier to use guards inside of lambda expressions.
    - If there were an expression similar to lambda expressions that could have
      guards and wasn't required to have at
      least one parameter, it could be used instead of `-XMultiWayIf`. This
      includes all uses of `-XMultiWayIf`, not just those inside of lambdas
      (see Example section).
 3. During the implementation of `-XLambdaCase`,
    [some suggested](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/4359#note_51110)
    allowing lambda expressions to have multiple clauses. This was not
    implemented: The most obvious approach of turning `\` into a layout herald
    had the disadvantage of making some common idioms invalid.
    - This could be circumvented by introducing a new expression that isn't required
      to be backwards compatible with existing idioms.

    </tr>

Aside from the explicit layout using `{`, `}`, and `;`, implicit layout as described in the Haskell
report can also be used.

Note the differences in the BNF to `\case`:
  - `\case` always has arity 1, whereas `\cases` can have any arity, including
    zero
  - The patterns in `\case` do not need to be parenthesized (as in `case`, with
    *pat*), whereas the patterns in `\cases` must be atomic or parenthesized
    (as in function definitions, with *apat*)
  - `\case` can have zero clauses, whereas `\cases` must have at least one
    clause

In expressions that have zero scrutinees and multiple guards, there is an ambiguity as to whether
the expression has multiple alternatives with one guard each or one alternative with multiple guards
(or any combination thereof). However, the semantics for these are equivalent, so this ambiguity can be
resolved in an arbitrary way.

#### Example

```haskell
filter = \cases _ []                 -> []
                p (x:xs) | p x       -> x : filter p xs
                         | otherwise ->     filter p xs
```

#### Changes

When the `-XLambdaCase` extension is enabled, a new
expression is added, introduced by the token sequence <tt>\\&nbsp;cases</tt>.
The whitespace between  `\` and `cases`
is optional and may contain an arbitrary sequence of whitespace characters.
`\cases` behaves in a way largely similar to `\`, but it is a layout herald.

As the BNF shows
 - There can be any number of *patterns* including zero (n &ge; 0)
 - There must be at least one clause (m &ge; 1). If there were zero clauses,
   the arity of the `\cases`-expression would be ambiguous (see `Alternatives`
   section for details).
 - As with `\case`-expressions, it is possible to use `where` blocks within
   each clause
 - Unlike `case`, `cases` is *not* a keyword. Only the token sequence `\` `cases`
   is treated specially (more precisely, lexically, `cases` is a *varid* rather than a
   *reservedid*, and it may be used as a variable).

As with function declaration equations, all clauses must have the same number of patterns.

Given a `\cases`-expression `csexp` with one or more scrutinees and a function
`f` declared with function declaration syntax, and with the same alternatives
and same guards for each alternative as `csexp`, the semantics of the
expression `mcexp` are the same as those of the expression `f`. If `csexp` has
no scrutinees, the semantics are the same as those of an expression `p`
declared with a pattern binding with the same guards as `csexp`.

The new expression matches function declaration syntax very closely, making
refactoring easy.


## Further Examples

Guards can be used instead of `-XMultiWayIf` inside lambda expressions:

```Haskell
{-# LANGUAGE MultiWayIf, BlockArguments #-}
take' :: Int -> [a] -> [a]
take' = flip $ flip foldr (const [])
  \x more n -> if | n > 0 -> x : more (n - 1)
                  | otherwise -> []

-- becomes

take' :: Int -> [a] -> [a]
take' = flip $ flip foldr (const [])
  \cases x more n | n > 0 -> x : more (n - 1)
                  | otherwise -> []
```

The new syntax could be used instead of `-XMultiWayIf` elsewhere as well:

```Haskell
foo = bar baz if | g1 -> a
                 | g2 -> b

-- with -XBlockArguments becomes

foo = bar baz \cases | g1 -> a
                     | g2 -> b
```

`\case` can be replaced by the new syntax:

```Haskell
\case Bar baz -> Just baz
      Quux -> Nothing

-- becomes

\cases (Bar baz) -> Just baz
       Quux -> Nothing
```

Unlike current `\case`, multiple patterns can be matched:

```Haskell
-- \case can't be used here!
-- At least not easily
\foo bar baz -> case (foo, bar, baz) of
  (Just 4, 3, False) -> 42
  _ -> 0

-- becomes

\cases
  (Just 4) 3 False -> 42
  _ _ _ -> 0
```

The new syntax can be used instead of regular function declaration syntax,
potentially resulting in more concise definitions:

```Haskell
extremelyLengthyFunctionIdentifier (Just a) False = Just 42
extremelyLengthyFunctionIdentifier (Just a) True  = Just (a / 2)
extremelyLengthyFunctionIdentifier _        _     = Nothing

-- becomes

extremelyLengthyFunctionIdentifier = \cases
  (Just a) False -> Just 42
  (Just a) True  -> Just (a / 2)
  _        _     -> Nothing
```

This also makes it possible to have `where` bindings that scope over multiple
equations

```Haskell
-- have to repeat the definition of `magicNumber` or place it outside the definition of
-- foo
foo (Just x) p | x < 0 = ...
               | let y = blah + 1 = ...
  where blah = x + magicNumber
        magicNumber = 5
foo Nothing _ = magicNumber
  where magicNumber = 5

-- becomes

-- note that the first `where` clause belongs to the first clause, rather than the
-- function declaration, because it is indented further

foo = \cases
  (Just x) p | x < 0 -> ...
             | let y = blah + 1 -> ...
    where blah = x + magicNumber
  Nothing _ -> magicNumber
  where
    magicNumber = 5
```

To illustrate with some real-world examples, this section shows
how some snippets found on hackage would look if they used this new syntax:

red-black-record-2.1.0.3/lib/Data/RBR/Internal.hs
```Haskell
_prefixNS = \case
    Left l -> S l
    Right x -> case x of Here fv -> Z @_ @v @start fv

_prefixNS = \cases
    (Left l) -> S l
    (Right x) -> case x of Here fv -> Z @_ @v @start fv
```

roc-id-0.1.0.0/library/ROC/ID/Gender.hs
```Haskell
printGender :: Language -> Gender -> Text
printGender = \case
  English -> printGenderEnglish
  Chinese -> printGenderChinese

printGenderEnglish :: Gender -> Text
printGenderEnglish = \case
  Male   -> "Male"
  Female -> "Female"

printGenderChinese :: Gender -> Text
printGenderChinese = \case
  Male   -> "Áî∑ÊÄß"
  Female -> "Â•≥ÊÄß"

-- becomes

printGender :: Language -> Gender -> Text
printGender = \cases
  English Male   -> "Male"
  English Female -> "Female"
  Chinese Male   -> "Áî∑ÊÄß"
  Chinese Female -> "Â•≥ÊÄß"
```

## Effect and Interactions

The new expression subsumes the functionality that `-XLambdaCase`
provides. (See "Alternatives" section for a discussion on deprecation.)

The proposed syntax can also be used instead of `-XMultiWayIf`, however in a
slightly more verbose manner, as shown in the "Further Examples" section.

(1) would introduce a new keyword and thus make it impossible to use the chosen
word for other purposes, though this would be gated behind an extension.

Since the proposal changes the existing `-XLambdaCase` extension, it is not
entirely backwards-compatible: Expressions like `\cases -> cases + 1` are now
interpreted differently when `-XLambdaCase` is active.

## Costs and Drawbacks

It is one additional syntactic construct to maintain, however the maintenance
cost should be fairly low due to the similarity to already existing constructs.

While this also means one additional construct to learn for beginners, the
syntax is largely consistent with similar constructs in the existing language,
and as such users might in fact be surprised that a construct with similar
capabilities doesn't yet exist.

## Alternatives

 - Instead of adding functionality to `-XLambdaCase`, a new extension, e.g.
   `-XLambdaCases` could be added. It might be desirable to have this new
   extension imply `-XLambdaCase`.
 - This proposal does not permit zero clauses, as with
   `case`-expressions and `-XEmptyCase`. This could be permitted. In this case, however, a way would have to be found
   to indicate how many arguments a given expression matches on, as otherwise, it would
   be ambiguous.
   The number of arguments an expression matches on becomes obvious from the
   clauses, e.g. `\cases a b -> ...` clearly matches on two arguments. Without clauses, this remains
   unclear. This means it would also be unclear whether the patterns are non-exhaustive:
   Consider the expression `f = \cases {} :: Bool -> Void -> a`. If the expression is supposed to match on
   both arguments, the patterns are exhaustive. If it is only supposed to match on the first argument
   and evaluate to a function of type `Void -> a`, it is not exhaustive. Moreover, in the former case,
   ``f undefined `seq` ()`` evaluates to `()`, whereas in the latter case, it evaluates to bottom.
   Currently, with `\case {}`, this problem doesn't arise, since it always matches on exactly one argument,
   and similarly for `case x of {}`, which only matches on `x`.
   A syntax to resolve this has been proposed in the discussion: `(\cases)` for matching on no arguments,
   `(\cases _)` for one, `(\cases _ _)` for two, and so on.
   Alternatively, [absurd patterns](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/discussions/423) could be introduced, which would provide a
   more general solution that could also be used in function definition syntax.

 - Regular lambda expressions could be extended to use layout and guards, however,
   this necessitates some potentially controversial decisions on when exactly to
   herald layout, since always doing so would disallow existing idioms; these would not
   be legal when the extension is enabled:
   ```haskell
   do
     f a >>= \b ->
     g b >>= \c ->
     h c

   foo = \x -> do
     a x
     b
   ```
   Two alternatives would be to only herald layout
     - if a newline immediately follows the `\` or
     - if, given that token `t` is the token after `\`, the line below the one with `t` has
       the same indentation as or greater than `t`

   Both of these would avoid the problem, but both rules are dissimilar from how layout heralding
   is handled in other Haskell constructs.

 - Expressions with zero patterns could be allowed only if the expression contains guards,
   rather than always being allowed.
   This would make them somewhat less consistent, but it is how lambda expressions work
   (i.e. `\ -> ...` is illegal) and only disallows expressions that are needlessly verbose (e.g.
   `\cases -> exp` can always be replaced by `exp`).

 - `\case` could be deprecated, since all its use cases
   (except for those involving `-XEmptyCase`) would
   be subsumed by `\cases`. However, the discussion of this proposal has shown that
   such a deprecation would be a controversial change in its own right, and that some
   working out has to be done as to the exact details of it, thus, this might
   be better suited to being its own, separate proposal.

 - The possibility to have a construct similar to `-XMultiWayIf` but without the keyword, i.e. using guards directly as
   an expression, was also raised in the discussion. If this were to be used, any pattern
   matching would have to be done with pattern guards.

 - A few alternative designs were discussed in greater detail. Denoting
   `\cases` as (1), these are

   - **(2): Comma-separated `\case`**

     Example:

     ```haskell
     filter = \case _, []               -> []
                    p, x:xs | p x       -> x : filter p xs
                            | otherwise ->     filter p xs
     ```

     This alternative does not introduce a new construct. It instead consists of a straightforward extension to an existing one:
     Allow separating multiple patterns in `\case` by commas. This makes it the
     least disruptive of the presented alternatives.

     A clause would only match if all of its patterns match their respective
     scrutinee.

     Rather than introducing a new extension, this behavior would be enabled by
     `-XLambdaCase`.

     Additionally, an analogous extension could be introduced for `case of`:

     ```haskell
     case numerator, denominator of
       _          , 0 -> Nothing
       Whole n    , d -> Whole (n `div` d)
       Complex a b, d -> Complex (a `div` d) (b `div` d)
     ```

     This can be used instead of using tuples to achieve something similar:

     ```haskell
     case (numerator, denominator) of
       (_          , 0) -> Nothing
       (Whole n    , d) -> Whole (n `div` d)
       (Complex a b, d) -> Complex (a `div` d) (b `div` d)
     ```

     With the advantage that users don't have to be worried or learn about whether
     using tuples in such cases incurs a performance penalty, and it would mean that the
     `\case` syntax stays consistent with `case of` syntax.

     This extension to `case of` would be enabled regardless of whether or not
     `-XLambdaCase` is turned on.

     If no clauses are given, i.e. the expression in question if `\case {}`, how
     many arguments this expression should take is ambiguous. However, currently,
     with `-XEmptyCase`, this expression is already valid and takes a single
     argument. Thus, to maintain backwards compatibility and for lack of a better
     option, this proposal does not alter the behavior of this expression.

     In general, the lack of parentheses makes this alternative slightly more
     concise than the others, especially in cases with only a single pattern.

     One potential concern is that this breaks the pattern of symmetry between
     expressions and patterns that match them. For example, if a function is defined
     as `f (Just a) (Right b) = a + b`, it can be called as `f (Just a) (Right b)`,
     but when using `\case` (i.e. `f = \case Just a, Right b -> a + b`), the patterns are
     separated by commas, whereas the expression calling `f` still uses parentheses.

   - **(3): One lambda per clause, `case of`**

     Example:

     ```haskell
     filter = case of \_ []                 -> []
                      \p (x:xs) | p x       -> x : filter p xs
                                | otherwise ->     filter p xs
     ```

     The functionality of `-XLambdaCase` is extended, according to the following
     schema:

     ```haskell
     case [ scrutinee ] of
       [ Pattern_0a ] \ Pattern_1a ... Pattern_na -> Expression_a
       [ Pattern_0b ] \ Pattern_1b ... Pattern_nb -> Expression_b
       ...
     ```

     Semantically, this would be equivalent to

     ```haskell
     \var_1 ... var_n -> case ([ scrutinee, ] var_1, ..., var_n) of
       ([ Pattern_0a, ] Pattern_1a, ..., Pattern_na) -> Expression_a
       ([ Pattern_0b, ] Pattern_1b, ..., Pattern_nb) -> Expression_b
     ```

     A new extension `-XExtendedCase` is introduced. With this new extension enabled,
     the `case` expression is able to define anonymous functions. The scrutinee
     may be omitted, in which case the corresponding pattern in each clause must also be
     omitted. Furthermore, in each clause, between the usual pattern (if it is present) and
     the arrow, a `\` and a number of patterns may be written. The
     number of patterns must be consistent across all clauses, and the types of
     corresponding patterns must match (e.g., the first pattern after the backslash
     must have the same type for all clauses). As usual, `case` clauses can
     contain guards as well.

     The number of patterns after each `\` determines the arity of the function that
     a `case` expression produces. The *n*th pattern after the `\` is matched
     against the *n*th argument given to the function.

     Note that the patterns after the `\` must be enclosed by parentheses if they
     consist of more than one token, just like patterns in a lambda expression, but
     unlike the pattern that can come before the `\`.

     If there is no scrutinee, it is not immediately clear what the meaning of an
     expression without clauses, i.e. the expression `case of {}`, should be, since
     the number of arguments to the anonymous function is not specified. Users might
     expect this to compile if the `-XEmptyCase` extension is enabled. However, due
     to the inherent ambiguity, this proposal does not allow a `case` expression
     that lacks both a scrutinee and clauses. Other approaches are possible, see
     Alternatives section.

     Like the existing behavior for alternatives in `case`
     expressions, and equations in function declaration syntax, it is
     possible to use `where` clauses within each clause of the extended `case`
     expression. Furthermore, each clause can have guards, which appear after all
     patterns.

     This alternative has some desirable properties, in that it extends an existing
     syntactic construct rather than introducing a new one and is syntactically
     similar to lambda expressions. On the other hand, it does not relate to
     existing syntax as directly as the alternatives (e.g., it produces an anonymous function
     but doesn't start with `\`, as opposed to lambda expressions and `\case`), and
     its functionality overlaps with that of `\case`.

     Since the introductory example only demonstrates the case without scrutinee,
     here is a different example:

     ```haskell
     sendEmail :: Text -> Text -> Text -> Maybe Attachment -> IO ()
     sendEmail address = case validate address of
       Just emailAddress \subject content (Just attachment) -> sendWithAttachment emailAddress subject content attachment
       Just emailAddress \subject content Nothing           -> sendWithoutAttachment emailAddress subject content
       Nothing           \_       _       _                 -> error "invalid address"
     ```

   - **(4): Multi-pattern `\case` with parentheses**

     Example:

     ```haskell
     filter = \case _ []                 -> []
                    p (x:xs) | p x       -> x : filter p xs
                             | otherwise ->     filter p xs
     ```

     Regular function definition syntax requires parentheses around patterns that
     consist of more than one token. The same could be done with `\case`. This would
     make the two syntaxes more consistent, and allow easy refactoring from one to
     the other. It also doesn't introduce any new syntactic constructs that have to
     be maintained.

     However, it behaves differently from the current `-XLambdaCase` extension,
     which doesn't require parentheses around patterns. This would seem to make it
     non-backwards-compatible, especially if it still uses the same `-XLambdaCase`
     extension name. This can be mitigated in various ways.

     First, a refactoring tool could be provided to update existing code and
     introduce parentheses where necessary, which would massively lower the effort
     required to update old code to be compatible with the new extension. Note that
     while the current `-XLambdaCase` extension doesn't *require* parentheses, it
     doesn't prohibit them, either. Thus, code updated with such a tool would
     work with both versions of the extension.

     Second, a special case could be introduced to have the compiler handle `\case`
     differently if there is only one pattern. More specifically, this means that
     the type checker detects when the first pattern in a clause is a solitary,
     non-nullary constructor. If this is the case, the AST is reconstructed such
     that the remaining patterns in the clause become arguments of this constructor.

     When this special case is triggered, the compiler would produce a warning
     (`-Wdeprecated-lambda-case`), which would be on by default, and warn the user
     that they're using syntax which will be deprecated at some future point. This
     would make it possible to remove the special casing and warning after a few
     releases have passed.

## Implementation Plan

I (Jakob Br√ºnker) will implement this proposal.
