This this the PR accompanying the process to define the ``GHC2021`` language set, as outlined in <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0372-ghc-extensions.rst>

Proposed Change
---------------

The ``GHC2021`` language extension set comprises of the following language extensions:

* Everything in ``Haskell2010``, plus
* TBD 

Data
----

The following table contains the information that was gathered to help the committee decide, based on an analysis of hackage and a community poll, as well as the tallied votes. At a committe size of 11, **8** votes are necessary to inclue an extension in ``GHC2021``:

The columns are:

* In GHC since: First version that ships this extension

  Some Extension may have had serious changes since then.

* Proliferation:   #(packages using that extensions)/#(packages parsed)
 
* Innocuousness:  #(packages enable it in .cabal)/#(packages using default-extensions)

  A high number here indicates that many developers want this on by default in their project, across all modules.

* Aloofness: #(packages using this, but _only_ in modules, despite using  default-extensions) /#(packages using default-extensions)

  A high number here indicates that, although a developer was in
  principle happy with putting extensions into the default-extensions
  field, they did not include this particular one. I take this as an
  indication that this extension does _not_ make a great on-by-default
  extension. (Matching my expectation, TemplateHaskell and CPP make
  the highest here)

* Popularity: #(users who want this)/#(users who filled out the poll)

* Contentionsness: #(users who donâ€™t want this)/#(users who want this)
